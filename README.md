# Tenzies

Tenzies is a game in which the goal is to continue rolling dice until all ten have the same value. At any time you may lock a die's number in order to stop rolling it.

This project is built with React and is based on the capstone project for FreeCodeCamp's [Beginner Tutorial for React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/). I made this game after watching the demonstration video for that project and removed features I thought were superfluous and added in other features I thought would make the game more interesting. The actual tutorial part of the project was not consulted.

## Running locally

After cloning the repository, simply:

```
cd Tenzies
```
to enter the directory,
```
npm install
```
to install the requirements, and
```
npm start
``` 
to run the project. The default port is 5173. If you would like to use a different port you can use an additional flag:
```
npm start -- --port <port-number>
```

This project was built with Nano React App. See the documentation [here](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app) and [here](https://github.com/nano-react-app/template-js).
